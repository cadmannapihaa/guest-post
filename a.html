    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">1. How We Collect and Use YOUR PERSONAL Information</h2>
    
    <!-- Section 1A: What Is Personal Information? -->
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">A. What Is Personal Information?</h3>
    <p>Personal information refers to information that we can use to personally identify a specific individual. Different states and countries define personal information (and similar terms, such as personal data and personally identifiable information) to include different things, but it generally includes information like your name, mailing address, email address, and phone number. It may also include your computer or mobile device IP address, if that IP address can be linked to a particular person, or geo-location information, again if that information can be used to pinpoint a specific person.</p>
    
    <!-- Section 1B: Providing Personal Information Is Your Choice -->
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">B. Providing Personal Information Is Your Choice.</h3>
    <p>You are in control of whether you provide us with your personal information – you can visit and view the Site without disclosing any personal information about yourself. However, if you choose to make use of certain features of the Site, you may need to provide certain personal information to us. For example, if you choose to use the Site to purchase tickets, list tickets for sale, or otherwise post content, you will need to create an account on the Site, and will be required to enter certain personal information.</p>
    
    <p>If you are not comfortable with providing information to us, you should not do so. Although that will affect your ability to use our ticket sales platform, that is your choice. If you do provide us with any personal information, you agree that it will be accurate and complete, and you understand that it is your responsibility to update your personal information as necessary to keep it current.</p>

    <!-- Section 1D: Certain Generally-Applicable Uses -->
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">D. Certain Generally-Applicable Uses of Personal Information.</h3>

    <!-- Section 2: HOW AND WHY WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION -->

    <p>We restrict access to your personal information to those who need to access it to use it as described in this privacy policy. We share personal information with third parties in the following circumstances:</p>
    
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
      <li>The Site Owner and Service Provider receive and share information as necessary to process ticket purchases.</li>
      <li>We will provide personal information to our trusted service providers who need to use that information to conduct business on our behalf. These third parties include the shipping companies who ship tickets, the credit card processing companies to complete billing and payment, and others who may assist us with email and newsletter distribution. We provide these service providers only with the information they need to perform their services, and work with them to respect and protect your privacy.</li>
      <li>We may share your personal information with our company affiliates and business partners for our and their legitimate business purposes, including so that we or they may provide you with promotional emails, special offers, or other materials that may interest you. If you do not wish for us to share your information in this manner, please let us know by contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@ticketingspro.com" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">support@ticketingspro.com</a>. However, please note that we are not responsible for the privacy policies of these third parties once they have received your information.</li>
      <li>We will release information, including personal information, if we believe that doing so is appropriate to (a) comply with law, regulations, legal process or governmental request, (b) enforce any policies applicable to the Site, including potential violations, (c) detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) otherwise protect the rights, property or personal safety of us, our employees, Site users, or others.</li>
      <li>We may share information, including personal information, in connection with, during negotiations of, or as a part of the closing of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company in which personal information about the users of our Site is among the assets transferred.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>We do not sell, rent, or lease any personal information that we collect about you through the Site to anyone for any purpose, other than as disclosed, unless you have given us your separate express permission to do so.</p>
    
    <p>We employ security measures to keep data in transit completely secure, and if we disclose your personal information to a third party for a business purpose, we enter into a contract that describes the purpose and requires the recipient to both keep that personal information confidential and not use it for any purpose except performing the contract.</p>
    
    <!-- Section 3: COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGY -->
    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">3. COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGY</h2>
    
    <!-- Section 3A: How We Use Cookies -->
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">A. How We Use Cookies.</h3>
    <p>Cookies are small text files that are stored on your browser, device, or the page you are viewing when you visit a website. Some cookies are deleted once you close your browser or application (session cookies), while other cookies are retained even after you exit so that you can be recognized when you return (persistent cookies). We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our Site. We use persistent cookies to store your email address and, subject to your setting preferences, your account login information, so you don't have to enter it more than once. We also use persistent cookies to store purchase and log data, and to personalize your shopping experience, and to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience on our Site.</p>
    
    <p>Cookies do not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user, and we do not link the information stored in cookies to any personal information that you submit when using our Site.</p>
    
    <p>Most web browsers automatically accept cookies and other tracking technologies, but you can usually change your settings to prevent that, such as by having your device warn you each time a cookie is being sent or choosing to turn off all cookies. On our Site, you will be able to disable all cookies other than persistent cookies that are required when you make a purchase. This can be done through your web browser settings, and because each browser is different, you should look at your browser's "Help" menu to learn how to modify your cookie settings.</p>
    
    <p>If you do disable cookies from your browser you may not be able to access certain sections of the Site that use essential cookies, and this may make your experiences on the Site less efficient.</p>
    
    <!-- Section 3B: Third Party Tracking Technologies -->
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">B. Third Party Tracking Technologies.</h3>
    <p>We may allow third parties to set cookies during your visit to the Site. These are third parties that provide us with information about how you use the Site. They may also use cookies, on our behalf, to promote our newest products and services on other websites based on your activity on our Site. For example, you may see tickets or events that you viewed on our Site presented on other websites as you move around the internet.</p>
    
    <p>In addition, various third parties, including our analytics providers and our ad partners, may use cookies, alone or with other tracking technology, to collect information about you when you use the Site for their own purposes, independent from us. These third parties may be able to associate the information they collect with your personal information, or they may collect information, including personal information, about your online activities over time and across other website and online services. They may use this information to provide you with behavioral advertising or other targeted content on other websites and through other media.</p>
    
    <p>We cannot control any third parties' tracking technologies or how they may be used. If you have any questions about an advertisement or other targeted content, you should contact the responsible provider directly.</p>
    
    <!-- Section 3C: Do Not Track Requests -->
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">C. Do Not Track Requests.</h3>
    <p>Currently, certain browsers offer a "do not track" (DNT) option. This option, using a technology known as a DNT header, sends a signal to websites visited by the user about the user's DNT preference, if any, set on the browser. We do not currently commit to responding to browsers' DNT signals. We cannot make this commitment because there is not a common understanding among industry groups, technology companies, or regulators about how to interpret the DNT signal.</p>
    
    <!-- Section 4: third party sites and SOCIAL SHARING FEATURES -->
    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">4. third party sites and SOCIAL SHARING FEATURES</h2>
    
    <p>Our Site may include links to other websites. We do not control the privacy practices of any third parties, and if you submit personal information to any of those sites, their collection and use of your information is governed by their privacy policies, which differ from ours. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any website you visit.</p>
    
    <p>Our Site may offer social network and similar sharing features, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and similar buttons, which let you share information related to the Site through your preferred social media platforms. If you permit a connection between our Site and your social network page(s), we (and the social network) may be able to identify you, and associate the information we (and they) receive with information we (and they) already have about you. In addition, depending on how you use those features and your settings with the social network provider(s), the information you share to your social network pages will be available to others, including your friends and/or the public. For more information about how your information may be shared through those social networks once it is provided to them, you should review the privacy policies of those social networks.</p>
    
    <!-- Section 5: Our Security Measures -->
    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">5. Our Security Measures</h2>
    
    <p>We use a variety of industry-standard security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information, including measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration and disclosure. We store the personal information you provide on secure (password- and firewall-protected) servers. All electronic financial transactions conducted through our Site are protected by encryption technology.</p>
    
    <p>Unfortunately, no electronic data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we believe that we use reasonable measures to protect personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information transmitted or otherwise provided to us or received from us.</p>
    
    <p>If you have an account on our Site, it is your responsibility for keeping the password confidential. We will never ask for your password (except when you create your account and log into our Site).</p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="font-medium">Object to processing</p>
        <p>of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms.

    <p>In addition to the business or commercial purpose of collection of personal information described above, we may use any of the personal information we collect for the general purposes disclosed in our main privacy policy, and may disclose personal information for our business and commercial purposes as described in our main privacy policy.</p>
    
    <!-- Section 3: INFORMATION ABOUT SALES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION -->
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">3. INFORMATION ABOUT SALES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
    
    <p>In the past 12 months, we have not sold any personal information.</p>
    
    <p>While the CCPA has a broad definition of what constitutes a sale of information, many types of transfers of information do not qualify as "sales" under the CCPA. We have carefully evaluated the manner in which we share information to determine that we do not sell your personal information.</p>
    
    <p>As noted above, we share information with our service providers (including Service Provider) who need the information in order to perform contracted services for us. This may include transfers such as those to Service Provider as necessary to process orders for tickets, and transfers to our credit card processors to complete payments. We enter into agreements with each service provider that limit the purposes for which the personal information may be used and that require the third party to keep that personal information confidential. With these protections, these transfers are not considered "sales" under the CCPA.</p>
    
    <!-- Right to Opt-Out of Sale or Sharing -->
    <h4 class="text-md font-medium mt-3 mb-2">Right to Opt-Out of Sale or Sharing of Personal Information</h4>
    
    <p>If you are a California resident, you have the right to direct us to stop selling or sharing your Personal Information. You may submit a request to opt out of sales or sharing through our interactive webform available by clicking on this link: <a href="https://www.ticketingspro.com/privacy.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">https://www.ticketingspro.com/privacy.html</a>. You also may submit a request by calling us at <a href="tel:+18887695428" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline"><strong>(888)769-5428</strong></a> or emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@ticketingspro.com" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">support@ticketingspro.com</a>.</p>
    
    <!-- Section 4: YOUR RIGHTS AND CHOICES REGARDING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION UNDER THE CCPA -->
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">4. YOUR RIGHTS AND CHOICES REGARDING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION UNDER THE CCPA</h3>
    
    <p>The CCPA provides <strong>California residents</strong> with certain specific rights regarding their personal information. This section describes your CCPA rights, and explains how to exercise them. Please note that your rights are subject to limitations and exceptions described in the CCPA.</p>
    
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
      <li>Right to Access Certain Information – You have the right to ask us to provide you with information about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months.</li>
      <li>Right to Data Portability – You have the right to ask us to provide you with copies of personal information that we have collected about you, in a portable and readily-usable format.</li>
      <li>Right to Request Deletion of Certain Information – You have right to ask us to delete personal information about you that we have collected and retained.</li>
      <li>Right to Non-Discrimination – You have the right not to be discriminated against for exercising any of your CCPA rights.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>If you make a request to delete your personal information, we can deny that request if we or our service providers need to keep the information to:</p>
    
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
      <li>Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide you with a product or service you have requested, take other actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform a contract with you;</li>
      <li>Detect security incidents, protect against illegal or fraudulent behavior, or engage in legal actions with persons responsible for such activities;</li>
      <li>Debug products to identify and repair errors impacting the functionality of our Site or services;</li>
      <li>Exercise free speech or ensure other consumers' rights to free speech, or otherwise exercise rights provided by law;</li>
      <li>Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code §1546);</li>
      <li>Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information's deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research's achievement, if you previously provided informed consent;</li>
      <li>Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us;</li>
      <li>Comply with a legal obligation;</li>
      <li>Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>To exercise any of the rights described above, you must submit a verifiable consumer request to us. You can do so by:</p>
    
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
      <li>Sending us an email with the subject heading "California Privacy Rights" at <a href="mailto:support@ticketingspro.com" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">support@ticketingspro.com</a></li>
      <li>Calling us at (888) 769-5428</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you expressly authorize to act on your behalf, can make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.</p>
    
    <p>If you contact us to exercise your California privacy rights, you must attest to the fact that you are a California resident, and provide us with a current California address. We cannot respond to your request or provide you with information if we cannot identify you or confirm your authority to make the request, so any request will require you to provide sufficient information to allow us to reasonably verify your identity and/or the identity and authorization of your agent (if applicable). We will only use any personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requesting party's identity or authority to make the request, by matching that information with the personal information we already have about you. If you have an account on the Site, we will also verify your identity using our standard authentication practices for your account.</p>
    
    <p>We will respond to any verifiable consumer request in the manner and within the timeframes required by the CCPA.</p>
    
    <p>You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within any 12-month period.</p>
    
    <!-- Section 5: OTHER CALIFORNIA RIGHTS -->
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">5. OTHER CALIFORNIA RIGHTS</h3>
    
    <p>In addition to the CCPA, California's <strong>"Shine the Light"</strong> law permits California residents to request certain details about our disclosure of their personal information to third parties for those third parties' own direct marketing purposes. If you are a <strong>California resident</strong> and you would like to make such a request, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@ticketingspro.com" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">support@ticketingspro.com</a>. Please note that there are legal limits on how often you can make such a request, and we are only obligated to respond to one information request per customer per year.</p>
    
    <p>In addition, if any <strong>California residents</strong> under the age of 18 have used the Site, created an account, and posted content or information on the Site, they can request removal by contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@ticketingspro.com" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">support@ticketingspro.com</a>, detailing where the content is posted and confirming that they posted it. Following such a request, we will terminate the unauthorized account, and will make reasonable good faith efforts to remove any post or information from public view, or anonymize it so that the minor cannot be individually identified. However, removal of public postings cannot ensure complete or comprehensive removal, as third parties may republish, archive, or cache web content in a manner that is out of our control.</p>

    <h4 class="text-md font-medium mt-3 mb-2">Promotional offers from us</h4>
    <p>We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing). You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or purchased services from us and, in each case, you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.</p>
    
    <h4 class="text-md font-medium mt-3 mb-2">Third-party marketing</h4>
    <p>We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any company outside of TicketsonSale.com LLC for marketing purposes.</p>
    
    <h4 class="text-md font-medium mt-3 mb-2">Opting out</h4>
    <p>You can ask us to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by selecting the "unsubscribe" link included in any email communications, or by contacting us at us at <a href="mailto:support@ticketingspro.com" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">support@ticketingspro.com</a>. Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, this will not apply to personal data that you have provided to us as a result of a purchase of travel services or other such transactions.</p>
    
    <h4 class="text-md font-medium mt-3 mb-2">Monitoring communications</h4>
    <p>We may monitor, record, store and use any telephone, email, or other communication with you in order to check any instructions given to us, for training purposes, for crime prevention and to improve the quality of our customer service.</p>
    
    <!-- Section 3: HOW AND WHY WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION -->
    <h2 id="L3" class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">3. HOW AND WHY WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
    
    <p>We restrict access to your personal information to those who need to access it to use it as described in this Privacy Policy. We share personal information with third parties in the following circumstances:</p>
    
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
      <li>TicketsonSale and our platform service provider receive and share information as necessary to process reservations and booking requests.</li>
      <li>We will provide personal information to our other trusted service providers who need to use that information to conduct business on our behalf. These third parties include the accommodation providers, the credit card processing companies to complete billing and payment, and others who may assist us with email and newsletter distribution. We provide these service providers only with the information they need to perform their services, and work with them to respect and protect your privacy.</li>
      <li>We may share your personal information with our business partners for our and their legitimate business purposes, including so that we or they may provide you with promotional emails, special offers, or other materials that may interest you. If you do not wish for us to share your information in this manner, please let us know by contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@ticketingspro.com" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">support@ticketingspro.com</a>. However, please note that we are not responsible for the privacy policies of these third parties once they have received your information.</li>
      <li>We will release information, including personal information, if we believe that doing so is appropriate to (a) comply with law, regulations, legal process or governmental request, (b) enforce any policies applicable to the site, including potential violations, (c) detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) otherwise protect the rights, property or personal safety of us, our employees, site users, or others.</li>
      <li>We may share information, including personal information, in connection with, during negotiations of, or as a part of the closing of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company in which personal information about the users of our site is among the assets transferred.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>We do not sell, rent, or lease any personal information that we collect about you through the site to anyone for any purpose, other than as disclosed, unless you have given us your separate express permission to do so.</p>
    
    <!-- Section 4: WHEN WE TRANSFER YOUR DATA OVERSEAS -->
    <h2 id="L4" class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">4. WHEN WE TRANSFER YOUR DATA OVERSEAS</h2>
    
    <p>We and many of our service providers are based outside the United Kingdom (UK) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the UK.</p>
    
    <p>Where you have requested a booking for travel arrangements which are located or otherwise due to be fulfilled outside the UK, we will have to transfer your personal data to the suppliers fulfilling or providing those travel arrangements outside the UK in order to make your booking and for those suppliers to be able to provide you with the travel arrangements you have booked. Where we are unable to rely on one of the safeguards outlined below when transferring data to those suppliers outside the UK, we will rely on the derogation under Article 49 of the GDPR in order to transfer your personal data to countries outside the UK (as the transfer relates to the performance of a contract for your benefit), and you hereby permit us to do so. You also acknowledge that where your personal data is transferred outside the UK, controls on data protection may not be as wide as the legal requirements within the UK.</p>
    
    <p>For all other transfers of data, whenever your personal data is transferred outside the UK, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p>
    
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
      <li>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data.</li>
      <li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved for use in the UK, which give personal data the same protection it has in UK.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@ticketingspro.com" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">support@ticketingspro.com</a> if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the UK.</p>
    
    <!-- Section 5: COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGY -->
    <h2 id="L5" class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">5. COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGY</h2>
    
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">A. How We Use Cookies.</h3>
    <p>Cookies are small text files that are stored on your browser, device, or the page you are viewing when you visit a website. Some cookies are deleted once you close your browser or application (session cookies), while other cookies are retained even after you exit so that you can be recognized when you return (persistent cookies). We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. We use persistent cookies to store your email address and, subject to our site features and your setting preferences, your account login information, so you don't have to enter it more than once. We also use persistent cookies to store purchase and log data, and to personalize your shopping experience, and to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience on our site.</p>
    
    <p>Cookies do not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user, and we do not link the information stored in cookies to any personal information that you submit when using our site.</p>
    
    <p>Most web browsers automatically accept cookies and other tracking technologies, but you can usually change your settings to prevent that, such as by having your device warn you each time a cookie is being sent or choosing to turn off all cookies. On our site, you will be able to disable all cookies other than persistent cookies that are required when you make a purchase. This can be done through your web browser settings, and because each browser is different, you should look at your browser's "Help" menu to learn how to modify your cookie settings.</p>
    
    <p>If you do disable cookies from your browser you may not be able to access certain sections of the site that use essential cookies, and this may make your experiences on the site less efficient.</p>
    
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">B. Third Party Tracking Technologies.</h3>
    <p>We may allow third parties to set cookies during your visit to the site. These are third parties that provide us with information about how you use the site. They may also use cookies, on our behalf, to promote our newest products and services on other websites based on your activity on our site. For example, you may see tickets that you viewed on our site presented on other websites as you move around the internet.</p>
    
    <p>We cannot control any third parties' tracking technologies or how they may be used. If you have any questions about an advertisement or other targeted content, you should contact the responsible provider directly.</p>
    
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">C. Do Not Track Requests.</h3>
    <p>Currently, certain browsers offer a "do not track" (DNT) option. This option, using a technology known as a DNT header, sends a signal to websites visited by the user about the user's DNT preference, if any, set on the browser. We do not currently commit to responding to browsers' DNT signals. We cannot make this commitment because there is not a common understanding among industry groups, technology companies, or regulators about how to interpret the DNT signal.</p>
    
    <!-- Section 6: THIRD PARTY SITE AND SOCIAL SHARING FEATURES -->
    <h2 id="L6" class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">6. THIRD PARTY SITE AND SOCIAL SHARING FEATURES</h2>
    
    <p>Our site may include links to third party websites. Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or share data about you. We do not control the privacy practices of any third parties, and if you submit personal information to any of those sites, their collection and use of your information is governed by their privacy policies, which differ from ours. We are not responsible for such third parties' privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any website you visit.</p>
    
    <p>Our site may offer social network and similar sharing features, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and similar buttons, which let you share information related to the site through your preferred social media platforms. If you permit a connection between our site and your social network page(s), we (and the social network) may be able to identify you, and associate the information we (and they) receive with information we (and they) already have about you. In addition, depending on how you use those features and your settings with the social network provider(s), the information you share to your social network pages will be available to others, including your friends and/or the public. For more information about how your information may be shared through those social networks once it is provided to them, you should review the privacy policies of those social networks.</p>
    
    <!-- Section 7: OUR SECURITY MEASURES -->
    <h2 id="L7" class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">7. OUR SECURITY MEASURES</h2>
    
    <p>We use a variety of industry-standard security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information, including measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration and disclosure. We store the personal information you provide on secure (password- and firewall-protected) servers. All electronic financial transactions conducted through our site are protected by encryption technology.</p>
    
    <p>Unfortunately, no electronic data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we believe that we use reasonable measures to protect personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information transmitted or otherwise provided to us or received from us.</p>
    
    <p>It is your responsibility for keeping all information associated with your reservation and, if applicable, all account information, confidential. We will never ask for any password (unless one is necessary to create an account).</p>
    
    <p>We employ security measures to keep data in transit completely secure, and if we disclose your personal information to a third party for a business purpose, we enter into a contract that describes the purpose and requires the recipient to both keep that personal information confidential and not use it for any purpose except performing the contract.</p>
    
    <!-- Section 8: HOW LONG WE RETAIN YOUR DATA FOR -->
    <h2 id="L8" class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">8. HOW LONG WE RETAIN YOUR DATA FOR</h2>
    
    <p>We collect personal information for as long as we reasonably continue to have a business need to do so (which will be at least as long as you continue have an open reservation or, if applicable, an account on our site), unless a longer period is required by law. Business needs include legal, taxation, accounting, risk management, and other business purposes.</p>
    
    <p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.</p>
    
    <p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see "How to Request Deletion of your Information" below for further information.</p>
    
    <p>In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you</p>

    <h2 id="L9" class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">9. YOUR RIGHTS REGARDING Your Information</h2>
    
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">A. General Rights.</h3>
    
    <h4 class="text-md font-medium mt-3 mb-2">Providing Personal Information Is Your Choice.</h4>
    <p>You can browse the site without providing any personal information, other than browsing data (which we will not attempt to link to any other personal information). However, if you choose to use the site to engage with us, such as by booking reservations or requesting information, you will be required to provide us with the necessary information. If you do not want to provide us with any information, you should not use our site.</p>
    
    <h4 class="text-md font-medium mt-3 mb-2">How to Update and Change Your Information.</h4>
    <p>If you have a reservation on our site that you wish to change, you can access and edit your reservation online. In addition, you can contact us at any time at <a href="mailto:support@ticketingspro.com" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">support@ticketingspro.com</a> to request that we make any edits to any personal information that you believe we maintain.</p>
    
    <h4 class="text-md font-medium mt-3 mb-2">How to Request Deletion of Your Information.</h4>
    <p>. As noted above, we have standard retention practices with respect to the personal data we collect, and your personal information will be retained and used as described in this Privacy Policy. If you would like to request any earlier removal of your personal information, you can also contact us at <a href="mailto:support@ticketingspro.com" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">support@ticketingspro.com</a>. Please note that we may not be able to completely remove personal information from the site or our systems in certain circumstances. This will be true if the data is not in a searchable format or if it is retained in backup systems or cashed or archived pages. Once we no longer need it to provide you with requested services, we will retain and use your information only as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, prevent fraud or future abuse, and enforce our agreements, including any site terms.</p>
    
    <h4 class="text-md font-medium mt-3 mb-2">Your Legal Rights.</h4>
    <p>You have certain legal rights regarding your information, including the right to request access, request correction, request erasure, object to processing, request restriction of processing, and request the transfer of personal data, as well as to withdraw previously-given consent to use your information in certain cases. Each of these rights is defined further below.</p>
    
    <h4 class="text-md font-medium mt-3 mb-2">No fee usually required</h4>
    <p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
    
    <h4 class="text-md font-medium mt-3 mb-2">What we may need from you</h4>
    <p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
    
    <h4 class="text-md font-medium mt-3 mb-2">Time limit to respond</h4>
    <p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>

    <p>You have the right to:</p>
    
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
      <li>
        <p class="font-medium">Request access</p>
        <p>to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="font-medium">Request correction</p>
        <p>of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="font-medium">Request erasure</p>
        <p>of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="font-medium">Object to processing</p>
        <p>of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="font-medium">Request restriction of processing</p>
        <p>of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:
          <ol class="list-decimal pl-6">
            <li>if you want us to establish the data's accuracy;</li>
            <li>where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it;</li>
            <li>where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or</li>
            <li>you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="font-medium">Request the transfer</p>
        <p>of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="font-medium">Withdraw consent at any time</p>
        <p>where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><u>We will never discriminate against a consumer for exercising any of these rights.</u> Further, in addition to these exercisable rights, we will never make business decisions about a consumer based solely on automated processing of their data without human input.</p>
